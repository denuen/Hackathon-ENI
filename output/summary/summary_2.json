I would tell one story if you hear me, I haven't seen him for 30 years. I don't know what he's doing, but he was walking around Berlin. Let's say, he was walking not just for entertainment purposes, but for listening. Listening and necessity. He approached the riverbank, and there sits an old man, a German, fishing. He asks him, my friend, how's the fishing? He turned around, looked up and down, and said, no. Pause, my friend asks, why? Another pause, the German fisherman turns, the wind is from the east. Our friend replies, well, that's all the problems, all the dirt from the east. The German sat, thought, turned, and said, honestly, I can't come up with anything. My friend thought, no, worse. Now he was thinking, raised his eyebrow, looked silently, and gave no answers. Why did I remember this now? Now everything from the east is better than from the west. Look at the conditions created for the German economy in Russia and from your traditional allies and partners. Now we are only talking about the business environment. But our doors are always open. We have always had very good relations with Germany for decades. We understood each other very well. The distinctive feature of German investments was that they did not strive to make quick money. They invested in the long term, in industry. I don't mean it was, and it was with Deutsch. But when I was already at a birthday in Hanover, it was modest but decent. Everyone spoke English. Even the Hanover choir performed songs in English. Shameful, you understand? That's the whole point. The level of confidence should be inside. That's where it all starts. When we say, I hear that Russia turned to the east, to the global south, Russia did not turn. Now towards the global south and east. No. Russia has long been engaged in this since the 2000s, considering global development trends, the development of the world economy. Calmly, step by step, but we've been doing this for a long time. In case of normalization of relations with the global west, although the global west does not exist, but everything becomes less and less global because its share in the world GDP is constantly decreasing. Do you understand what's happening? Those people who are engaged in this seem to have a good education, they graduate from Oxford, Cambridge, and so on. They should be smart people, but from what they do, they don't even understand, they are either well-educated and smart, but something prevents them from quickly and effectively responding to real changes in the world, and what prevents them. It's this, you know, what people call arrogance or snobbery. They think that everything is allowed for them, and they will do everything, no matter what. But the world is changing, and they can't do everything. What do I mean? That by their actions they are pushing the pace towards the creation of a multipolar world. Therefore, we will certainly be in the future. I hope it will happen when the normalization of our relations with our western partners occurs. First of all, because they themselves are interested in this. But we also have an interest, of course.",
