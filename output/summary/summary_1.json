I would tell one story if you hear me, I haven't seen him for 30 years. I don't know what he's doing now, but he was walking around Berlin. Let's say, he wasn't just walking for entertainment purposes, but for listening and necessity. He approached the riverbank, and there was an old German man fishing. My friend asked him, 'How's the fishing?' The old man turned, looked up, and said, 'No.' Pause. My friend asked, 'Why?' Another pause. The German fisherman turned and said, 'The wind is from the east.' My friend replied, 'Well, that's all the problems, all the dirt from the east.' The German sat, thought, turned, and said, 'Honestly, I can't think of anything.' My friend thought, 'No, worse.' Now he was puzzled, raised his eyebrows, looked silently, and didn't give any answers. Why did I remember this now? Now everything from the east is better than from the west. Look at the conditions created for the German economy in Russia and from your traditional allies and partners. We're only talking about the business environment now. But our doors are always open. We've always had very good relations with Germany for decades. We understood each other very well. The distinctive feature of German investments was that they didn't strive for quick money. They invested in the long term, in industry. I'm not saying it was, and it was with Deutsch. But when I was at a birthday in Hanover, it was modest but decent. Everyone spoke English. Even the Hanover choir sang songs in English. It's a shame, you know? That's the point. The level of confidence should be inside. That's where it all starts. When we say, I hear that Russia has turned to the east, to the global south, Russia hasn't turned. Now to the global south and east. No. Russia has long been doing this since the 2000s, considering global development trends, the development of the world economy. Calmly, step by step, but we've been doing this for a long time. In case of normalization of relations with the global west, although the global west doesn't exist, but everything becomes less and less global because its share in the world GDP is constantly decreasing. Do you understand what's happening? Those people who are engaged in this seem to have a good education, they graduate from Oxford, Cambridge, and so on. They should be smart people, but from what they do, they don't even understand, are they really like that, or maybe they are well-educated and smart, but something prevents them from reacting quickly and effectively to real changes in the world, and what prevents them? It's something, you know, that in the people is called arrogance or snobbery. They think that everything is allowed to them, and they will do everything despite anything. But the world is changing, and they can't do everything. What do I mean? That by their actions they are pushing towards the creation of a multipolar world. Therefore, we will certainly be in the future. I hope it will happen when the normalization of our relations with our western partners occurs. First of all, because they themselves are interested in this. But we also have an interest, of course.",
