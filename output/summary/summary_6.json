Mark, it's always good to see you. I can't think of many companies raising guidance in this environment of slowing economic growth and tariffs. What gives you the confidence to do that? Brian, everything went well for us this quarter. We had strong bookings, revenue, and currency performance, and we're raising our guidance by $400 million. Listen to this, Brian, we're going to do more than $41.3 billion, which is our guidance for Salesforce for the year. It's pretty incredible what's happening here. Now, you and I have talked about this in the past, but are more folks paying for Agent Force? More than $100 million in Agent Force ARR is happening, and more than $1 billion in Agent Force and Data Cloud ARR, which is pretty awesome. Mark, talk to us about this. We have more than 8,000 total Agent Force customers, and more than 4,000 of them are paying. So you're not seeing any slowdown in AI, despite some concerns about the Nvidia earnings miss, which was a shocker to me. Are you seeing any of that over at Salesforce? Well, we're seeing incredible results from customers. I have to tell you about this great story from Bella, which is an amazing company in Latin America. We did an Agent Force trial in their Colombia business, and it went so well that we're now deploying it throughout the whole region, all of Latin America. Mark, of course, I'm following the really big $8.8 billion deal in Latin America. One thing I heard from someone I talked to is that investors have gotten used to the margin expansion story you've driven at Salesforce over the past two years. Is this Mark Benioff back to making these big deals and then giving away that margin you've fought hard to reclaim? Well, this is accretive. Our margins are intact. We're continuing our buybacks and our dividend. We're going to do more than $14.5 billion in positive cash flow this year, so we have enough to satisfy every hungry mouth, which you just identified a few of them. But are you going to go back to making these big deals?\n\n## CHUNK 1\nMore than $100 million in Agent Force ARR now happening, but more than $1 billion in Agent Force and Data Cloud ARR, pretty awesome. Mark, talk to us about, of course, we're just to do, you know, that means we have more than 8,000 total Agent Force customers, more than 4,000 of them are paying Brian. So you're not seeing any slowdown in AI, you know, some concerns off that Nvidia earnings miss, shocker to me. I mean, are you seeing any of that over Salesforce? Well, we're just seeing some incredible results from customers. I have to tell you about this great story from Bella, which is this amazing [incerto] in Latin America. Are you familiar with them? We did this Agent Force trial in their Colombia business. It's gone so well that we're now deploying through the whole region, all of Latin America. Mark, of course, I'm following the really big eight, what an $8.8 billion on Informatica. This is one thing that I heard from one of the folks that I talked to is that they have gotten used to investors have gotten used to the margin expansion story that you have driven at Salesforce over the past two years. Is this Mark bending off back to making these big deals and then going to give away that margin that you've fought hard to reclaim? Well, this is creative. Our margins are intact. We're continuing our buybacks, we're continuing our dividend. And, you know, look, we're gonna do more than $14.5 billion in positive cash flow this year. So we have enough to get every hungry mouth, which is you just identified a few of them. But are you going to go back on making these big deals? Well, you can see how we have a whole new disciplined approach to acquisitions, Brian. And this deal specifically, you know, we walked away from it a year ago because the numbers were not exactly right. And then we came back to it because the numbers were right now. And this is just a great transaction for our company. Look, I've been working with Informatica since 2006. It's critical for every single one of our customers that they get their data together. You know, when they're moving into this AI age, Informatica is key to making that happen. It's gonna give them the harmonization. It really protects the data lineage. It gives them the ability to master data management. It's everything that you want in this modern era. And this is a great transaction. We've had so many customers call us and talk about how they're so excited that we've acquired this company. We're bringing this into our data cloud strategy. I mean, I expect that probably next year, we're gonna do more than $10 billion in data-type products. Like, you know, when we look at something like Agent Force, when we look at Data Cloud, when we look at Tableau, it's a huge part of our business now, Brad. Lastly, Mark, Informatica is known in some circles as the Switzerland of data, meaning they're a great independent third party. They do business with Oracle, which of course you know very well. AWS, talk to investors to the extent you could about any concerns about losing some deals because they know are, I guess no longer potentially that, that's Switzerland of data. Well, we, of course, buy companies that deeply integrate with all of these companies all the time. And so you know like a product like Tableau, you could say the same thing, and it's been a great success for us. All right, we'll leave it there. Mark Benioff, always nice to see you, sir. Congratulations. Brian, it's great to see you. I'll look forward to catching up again. All right, take care.",
